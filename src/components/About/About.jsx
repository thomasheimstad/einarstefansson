            Icelandic/Norwegian bass Einar Stefánsson is currently studying for a BMus (Hons) degree at the prestigious Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, UK.

            Einar regularly performs with the ambitious Edvard Grieg Youth Choir, of which he has been a member since its foundation in 2013. In addition to regular coachings and concerts with their mentor choir, the professional vocal ensemble Edvard Grieg Kor, the Youth Choir has performed with international artists such as The Rolling Stones, Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, Edward Gardner, Masaaki Suzuki and Sir Andrew Davies. Einar’s musical background and experience is broad, and although his main passion is music from the 19th Century, his musical interests span from Baroque opera and oratorio to contemporary music. Einar started his musical career playing the violin from the age of 5, among other things bringing him to play with the National Youth Orchestra in Norway, with which he toured in Canada, the United States, Russia and Norway. As a boy he joined the Bergen Boys’ Choir and later the Bergen Philharmonic Choir.

He has also had coaching with performers such as world-renowned pianist Helmut Deutsch and Einar Steen-Nøkleberg. Since 2016 Einar has been studying with internationally acclaimed bass Matthew Best at the Royal Northern College of Music with generous support from the Waverly Fund.
