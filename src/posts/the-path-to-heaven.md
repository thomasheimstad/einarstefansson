I plan to upload some pictures, reviews and other material from one of the most exciting projects I have been involved in lately, namely the world premiere of the opera The Path to Heaven by Adam Gorb and Ben Kaye (directed by Stefan Janski and performed with the terrific Psappha ensemble conducted by Mark Heron). It was really special to be part of this project, working with wonderful colleagues and creating the roles of Dr Rudi/Kapo/Nazi Officer. 

I will try to write more about this project soon but will leave a link to the opera website for now: https://www.tpth.org/ Do check it out, read about it and watch the video to get an impression of the opera!

It goes without saying that I completely dissociate myself from the beliefs and ideology of the characters I portrayed in the opera as well as the historical persons, regime and actions they are based on.
