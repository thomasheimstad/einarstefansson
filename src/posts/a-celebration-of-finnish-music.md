On Wednesday, 18 April, Einar will perform music by fellow Nordic musicians in a concert celebrating Finnish composers along with fellow RNCM students. Music by Rautavaara, Sibelius and Kuula and others. Very exciting performers and music, so come along to St. Chrysostom's Church in south Manchester if you are free and in the area on the evening of 18 April!
